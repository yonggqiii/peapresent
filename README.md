peapresent aims to be a program that compiles text in a specific format into a presentation in html format.

## Why html?
Current options for creating presentations may not be FOSS and may require proprietary software to run. Furthermore, they may not be cross-platform and cannot be viewed on different operating systems.

The peapresent compiler/decompiler aims to compile .pp files into an interactive html file so that any machine with a web browser can view and edit the presentations, vice versa.

## Why not use a GUI?
Text editors are easy to use, and can make it easy to define global settings for the presentation. Writing your presentation in text format will also allow you to focus on the content of the presentation and not on other aspects.

By storing your presentation files in text, it makes it easier to collaborate in groups without facing compatibility issues. Imagine working on your presentation as a group on GitHub!
